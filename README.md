# Simple HTTP Server & Client in C

This project implements a **minimal HTTP/1.1 server and client in C**, built from scratch using raw TCP sockets.  
It allows you to **host and download static files** (texts, images, videos, etc.) over HTTP â€” no external libraries required.

## How It Works

### ðŸ”¹ Server

1. Creates a socket and binds it to port **8080**. (can be changed in code)
2. Waits for incoming HTTP `GET` requests.
3. Automatically detects MIME types (`.html`, `.css`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.mp4`, `.webm` and `.txt` as the last option for any different types).
4. Determines which subfolder to read from using `get_folder_type()`.
```
arquivos/
â”œâ”€â”€ codigos/
â”œâ”€â”€ imagens/
â”œâ”€â”€ videos/
â”œâ”€â”€ musicas/
â””â”€â”€ textos/
```
5. Reads and sends the requested file to the client, preceded by the appropriate HTTP header.  
6. Handles invalid or missing files with a **404 response**.

### ðŸ”¹ Client

1. Resolves the target hostname (e.g., `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`).  
2. Connects to the server on port **8080**. (can be changed in code)
3. Sends an HTTP `GET` request for a specific file path (e.g., `/Kermit.gif`).  
4. Reads the HTTP header until `\r\n\r\n`.  
5. Extracts the `Content-Length` to determine file size.  
6. Writes all received bytes to `arquivos/<filename>`.  
7. Closes the connection once transfer is complete.

## Compilation

- Server
```bash
cd server
make
```

- Client

## How to Run
```bash
# Start the server
./server

# Run the client
./client http://host /<filename>
```
